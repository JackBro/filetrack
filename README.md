<h1>filetrack</h1>

Project dedicated to monitor directory / file changes in Linux

<h2>Details</h2>

Due to the great importance of keeping a record of all changes to files and folders on your computer or server, we have developed FileTrack, a small tool for Linux that allows you to monitor a folder, including subfolders, to detect changes in files or directories.
